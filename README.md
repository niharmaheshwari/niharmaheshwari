Hi! I am a computer science graduate student at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu) interested in Machine Learning and System Engineering.

I previously worked at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com) as a systems engineer responsible for developing, maintaining and scaling a [reference data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_data_(financial_markets)) engine.

I enjoy running, listening to [post-rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock) / [shoegaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze) music and building new things (of-course!)
